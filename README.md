######Application Features

* This application is a map of Downtown Manhattan that displays popular
places in the area. It utilizes the **Yelp, Wikipedia API** to get reviews,
photos and nearby places of the location. The details can be viewed by clicking the
marker as infoWindow. 

* There is a search bar functionality to search and filter map markers by either
name or type. (Type name of place or bakery, restaurant, cafe or pharmacy).
The search function filters on markers that initially show up
(locations pulled using nearbySearch og Google Maps API). 

* A list view of the set of locations is implemented. Searching and filtering
the locations via the search bar will filter the list view and map marker
locations accordingly.

* Selecting a location via list item or map marker causes the map marker
to bounce and change color(icon) to indicate that the location has been
selected and associated info window opens above map marker with information.

* The app also has autocomplete feature for the search bar. As soon as a address
is selected from autocomplete all map markers and list is cleared and updated
with the searched/filtered place.
